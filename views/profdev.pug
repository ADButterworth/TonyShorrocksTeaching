        h1 Professional Development

        p I have been involved in the professional development of instrumental teachers since 1995 when the ABRSM started the Certificate of Teaching (CT) course. I was invited to become a Mentor, and over the next 20 years worked as a Mentor to groups of students in Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield. 

        p I was subsequently asked to give INSET days to music services in Lincoln, Dorset and Gateshead and In 2006 I was able to create, run and teach a masters level course at Liverpool University that had a strong Pedagogy strand which further developed my experience and ideas and has led to several graduates of that course asking for input and advice on teaching matters as a mentor to their teaching practises work, most recently “Musical Minds” based in north Liverpool and the “Lavigne” music teaching school in Beijing.  

        p I can offer tailor-made input for individuals, groups, and institutions as one-offs or as a series of sessions over whatever period of time is desired. The one-to-one - or groups of perhaps up to 4 at a time - lesson of so much instrumental teaching is often neglected as a subject of study and often benefits enormously from comment and ideas from an experienced outsider, and I can offer observations and structured work on most aspects of instrumental teaching and learning.

        p Different levels of professional development might be:
        ul
            li One-off observations of lessons and feedback and comment sessions following them
            li One-off lessons for “stuck” pupils
            li Specific problem solving sessions with both teacher and pupil gaining ways into tackling individual problems
            li Viewing of videos of lessons with the teacher to develop self-observational skills
            li A series of videos or lesson observations, the number of which is decided in advance with the intention of creating linearity and development.

        p Any other requests or ideas you might have please contact me. 
        p The only silly questions are the ones that are not asked.
