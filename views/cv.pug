        p Over my career I have gained playing experience with the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra/BBC Philharmonic, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Opera North, and others in the North of England.

        h2 Conducting / Directing

        p For 20 years I directed and conducted the Liverpool University Symphony Orchestra, taking them on tours to Italy, Germany and France and the Chamber Orchestra to its own 10 day summer course in Normandy. I gained my teaching experience at the College of Ripon and York St. John, then Liverpool Hope University and since 1995 at Liverpool University. After appointed as Head of Performance a year later in 1996 I set out to develop a performance course for the undergraduate degree that has annually attracted positive comments from the external examiners reports. Building on that success a masters level course was developed with a symbiotic performance and pedagogy content.

        p Currently I am Artistic Director of the international youth orchestra project “Music, a Bridge Between People” with orchestral members drawn from 12 Meditereanean countries and have just been appointed to a consultant to a large Beijing music teaching school.
